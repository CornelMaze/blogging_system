npm install -g npm@7.19.1


Blogging System with Node.Js and MySQL
---------------------------------------
This Blogging System has the following functionality. The users can signup, login, perform CRUD operations, Image Upload and Comment on other posts.
Functionality wise we would perform: CRUD, DB Migrations, DB Seeds, Data Validation, Authentications(Token Based), Image Uploading and Relationships.
We would use express and sequelize
Database Tables:
 => users
  - id
  - name
  - email
  - password

 => posts
  - id
  - title
  - content
  - image_url
  - categoryId
  - userId

 => categories
  - id
  - name

=> comments
 - id
 - content
 - postId
 - userId

Sequelize is the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) that we are using. With this we can run queries without writing SQL.

To initialize sequelize we run:
 => sequelize init

To have sequelize-cli run:
 => npm install -g sequelize-cli
Sequelize would be installed globally on your cli.
This command would create:
 - config
  => config.json
 - migrations
 - models
  => index.js
 - seeders

To create a model using sequelize we write:
 => sequelize model:generate --name ModelName --attributes tableFields:type, tableFields:type

 => sequelize model:generate --name Post --attributes title:string,content:text,imageUrl:string,categoryId:integer,userId:integer

To run our migrations we write:
 => sequelize db:migrate

For our Validation we would use fastest-validator:
 => npm install fastest-validator

For our Authentications we need bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
 => npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken

For our environment file we use dotenv
 => npm i dotenv

For Uploading images we use multer
 => npm i multer


npm install sequelize fastest-validator bcryptjs jsonwebtoken dotenv multer express
